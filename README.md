# Network- and Enrichment-based Inference of Phenotypes and Targets from large-scale Disease Maps

Complex diseases are inherently multifaceted, and the associated data are often heterogeneous, making linking interactions across genes, metabolites, RNA, proteins, cellular functions, and clinically relevant phenotypes a high-priority challenge. Disease maps have emerged as knowledge bases that capture molecular interactions, disease-related processes, and disease phenotypes with standardized representations in large-scale molecular interaction map. Various tools are available for disease map analysis, but an intuitive solution to perform in silico experiments on the maps in a wide range of contexts and analyze high-dimensional data is currently missing. To this end, we introduce a novel two-dimensional enrichment analysis (2DEA) approach to infer downstream and upstream elements through the statistical association of network topology parameters and fold changes from molecular perturbations. We implemented our approach in a plugin suite for the MINERVA platform, providing an environment where experimental data can be mapped onto a disease map and predict potential regulatory interactions through an intuitive graphical user interface.
